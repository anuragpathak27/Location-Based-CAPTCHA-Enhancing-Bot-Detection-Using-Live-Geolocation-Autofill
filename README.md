# Location-Based-CAPTCHA-Enhancing-Bot-Detection-Using-Live-Geolocation-Autofill

## Overview
This repository contains the **web-based code** for the research paper **"Location-Based CAPTCHA: Enhancing Bot Detection Using Live Geolocation Autofill"**, presented at the **2024 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)**. The project introduces a novel CAPTCHA system that utilizes **live geolocation data** to detect bots, improving both **security** and **user experience**.

## Features
- Uses **HTML5 Geolocation API** to autofill user location.
- Detects **bots** by validating real-time geolocation access.
- Lightweight **JavaScript-based** frontend system.
- Simple user interface with responsive design.

## Live Demo

## Dataset
No external dataset is required. The CAPTCHA system works dynamically using the **userâ€™s device location**, making it lightweight and real-time.

## Repository Contents
- `index.html` â€“ The main webpage layout.
- `style.css` â€“ Styling for the CAPTCHA UI.
- `script.js` â€“ JavaScript logic for geolocation capture and validation.
